            <h2>Using libGDX with RxScala</h2>
            <p><b>Welcome!</b></p>
            <p>
                This tutorial demonstrates how to start developing a game (for Android, probably) in a
                <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/"><b>reactive</b></a> way using two great libraries combined:
                <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/"><b>libGDX</b></a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala"><b>RxScala</b></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two libraries are glued together by the small utility library <a href="https://github.com/jmhofer/rxjava-libgdx"><b>rxjava-libgdx</b></a>,
                which provides observables for typical libGDX events like input, lifecycle or physics events. It's very much a work in progress, though.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure and build of this project is quite complicated at a first glance. This is due to libGDX being a <b>multi-platform framework</b>.
                Also, targeting <b>Android</b> in a build system always creates some overhead. However, I'll walk you through.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Structure</h2>
            <p>
                This build is a typical <a href="http://scala-sbt.org"><b>sbt</b></a> <b>multi-project</b> build.
            </p>
            <p>
                For building Android,
                it uses the <a href="https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin"><b>android-sdk-plugin</b></a>
                (which is included in the <a href="#code/project/plugins.sbt" class="shortcut">plugins</a> definition).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can view the build definition <a href="#code/project/Build.scala" class="shortcut">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will notice that there are three sub-projects defined in the build:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#code/core" class="shortcut"><b>core</b></a> - This is the place for the platform-independent game core.</li>
                    <li><a href="#code/desktop" class="shortcut"><b>desktop</b></a> - Here goes code related to the desktop version of the game.</li>
                    <li><a href="#code/android" class="shortcut"><b>android</b></a> - Here goes code related to the Android version of the game.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <tt>desktop</tt> and <tt>android</tt> directories, you'll mostly find boilerplate necessary for the game to run on these platforms.</p>
            <p>
                The interesting things happen in <tt>core</tt>.
            </p>

            <h2>Oldschool vs. Reactive</h2>
            <p>
                Developing a <b>libGDX</b> game is a quite straightforward experience, thanks to the clear structure of the framework.
                However, libGDX expects an <b>oldschool</b> object-orientated (aka non-functional)
                <a href="http://elm-lang.org/learn/Escape-from-Callback-Hell.elm">callback-ridden</a> way of doing things from you.
            </p>
            <p>
                A simple oldschool libGDX game might start out something like this (for more information,
                see <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Extending%20the%20Simple%20Game">here</a>):
<pre><code>class SampleGame extends Game {
  var batch: SpriteBatch = _
  var font: BitmapFont = _

  def create(): Unit = {
    batch = new SpriteBatch
    font = new BitmapFont
    setScreen(new MainMenuScreen(this))
  }

  def render(): Unit = super.render()

  def dispose(): Unit = {
    batch.dispose()
    font.dispose()
  }
}</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                See all the vars? See all the effects? See all the callbacks?
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't want to play by these rules. We're the cool new gals. We're the <b>Reactivsters</b>. And that's why we're going
                to break out of that framework and basically use <b>Rx Observables</b> for everything.
            </p>

            <h2>Intro to Rx</h2>

            <p>
                Along comes the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Way</a>.
                It might look like bullshit bingo material at first glance. However, if you take a closer look,
                you'll notice that it's a whole new way of thinking about your programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's about thinking in <b>event streams</b>.</p>
            <p>
                These event streams are called <b>"observables"</b> in Rx terminology. And that's basically all there is
                to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't write an Rx tutorial here. You can find a lot of good ones on your own. Here's a good
                <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki">starting point</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Reactive is quite the hype, you'll find that there are a lot of other reactive libraries besides RxJava
                out there, for example
                <a href="http://www.typesafe.com/activator/template/akka-stream-scala"><b>Akka Reactive Streams</b></a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-stream"><b>Scalaz Streams</b></a>. Pick your poison.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tutorial is based on RxJava/RxScala, though, because I think that this is a very good choice for Android
                development specifically.
            </p>
            <p><i>Next: <a href="#tutorial/4">Reactive Game Lifecycle</a></i></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Reactive Game Lifecycle</h2>

            <p>
                The starting point for a libGDX game is its <b>lifecycle</b>, usually manifested in an
                <tt><b><a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/ApplicationListener.html">ApplicationListener</a></b></tt>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, we'd like to have a stream of observable <b>lifecycle events</b> instead. And that's exactly what
                <tt><b><a href="https://github.com/jmhofer/rxjava-libgdx/blob/master/src/main/java/rx/RxGame.java">RxGame</a></b></tt> gives us.
            </p>
            <p>
                We just have to wire it up first:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#code/android/src/rx/sample/game/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Android Wiring Code</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#code/desktop/src/main/scala/rx/sample/game/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Desktop Wiring Code</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, we can finally start putting
                <a href="#code/core/src/main/scala/rx/sample/game/SampleRxGame.scala" class="shortcut"><b>our game code</b></a>
                into the <code>start</code> method of <code>RxGame</code> and begin with handling the lifecycle events.
            </p>
            <p><i>Next: <a href="#tutorial/5">Tuning into the Lifecycle</a></i></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Tuning into the Lifecycle</h2>

            <p><a href="#code/core/src/main/scala/rx/sample/game/SampleRxGame.scala" class="shortcut">Lifecycle game code</a></p>
            <p>
                The first thing to do with the stream of lifecycles is publish it to multiple subscribers. This leaves us
                with a <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Connectable-Observable-Operators"><code>ConnectableObservable</code></a>
                called <code><b>connector</b></code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                From this, we retrieve the very simple stream <code><b>create</b></code> of create events (well, just the one event),
                as well as the render stream <code><b>renders</b></code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, we need some ugly type annotations around this in order to tell the compiler that we want to work with the Scala
                version of all the observables instead of the Java version.
            </p>
            <p>
                We simply map the <code>create</code> event (which doesn't carry any information itself) into game resources.
                This is a very nice way of <b>making the resources accessible to
                other streams</b> (especially the render stream), without having to resort to singletons or mutable state anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Transforming-Observables#scan"><code><b>scan</b></code></a> the render stream
                into a stream of game events called <code><b>gameRenders</b></code>. This allows us to compute a new game world from the previous one on each render step.
                This is a simple, yet very neat way of stepping through your game without mutation (as long as you don't want to do game
                computations independent of render events).
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to be able to display the game state, we still have to combine our game render events with the resources.
                This is easily achieved via the <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Combining-Observables#combinelatest"><code><b>combineLatest</b></code></a>
                operator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we subscribe to the combined stream with a very simple render method defined in the <code>SampleRxGame</code> companion object below,
                and connect.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's it (for now)!
