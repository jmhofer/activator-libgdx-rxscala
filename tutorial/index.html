            <h2>Using libGDX with RxScala</h2>
            <p><b>Welcome!</b></p>
            <p>
                This tutorial demonstrates how to start developing a game (for Android, probably) in a
                <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/"><b>reactive</b></a> way using two great libraries combined:
                <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/"><b>libGDX</b></a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala"><b>RxScala</b></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two libraries are glued together by the small utility library <a href="https://github.com/jmhofer/rxjava-libgdx"><b>rxjava-libgdx</b></a>,
                which provides observables for typical libGDX events like input, lifecycle or physics events. It's very much a work in progress, though.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure and build of this project is quite complicated at a first glance. This is due to libGDX being a <b>multi-platform framework</b>.
                Also, targeting <b>Android</b> in a build system always creates some overhead. However, I'll walk you through.

            <h2>Project Structure</h2>
            <p>
                This build is a typical <a href="http://scala-sbt.org"><b>sbt</b></a> <b>multi-project</b> build.
            </p>
            <p>
                For building Android,
                it uses the <a href="https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin"><b>android-sdk-plugin</b></a>
                (which is included in the <a href="#code/project/plugins.sbt" class="shortcut">plugins</a> definition).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can view the build definition <a href="#code/project/Build.scala" class="shortcut">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will notice that there are three sub-projects defined in the build:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#code/core" class="shortcut"><b>core</b></a> - This is the place for the platform-independent game core.</li>
                    <li><a href="#code/desktop" class="shortcut"><b>desktop</b></a> - Here goes code related to the desktop version of the game.</li>
                    <li><a href="#code/android" class="shortcut"><b>android</b></a> - Here goes code related to the Android version of the game.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <tt>desktop</tt> and <tt>android</tt> directories, you'll mostly find boilerplate necessary for the game to run on these platforms.</p>
            <p>
                The interesting things happen in <tt>core</tt>.

            <h2>Oldschool vs. Reactive</h2>
            <p>
                Developing a <b>libGDX</b> game is a quite straightforward experience, thanks to the clear structure of the framework.
                However, libGDX expects an <b>oldschool</b> object-orientated (aka non-functional)
                <a href="http://elm-lang.org/learn/Escape-from-Callback-Hell.elm">callback-ridden</a> way of doing things from you.
            </p>
            <p>
                A simple oldschool libGDX game might start out something like this (for more information,
                see <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Extending%20the%20Simple%20Game">here</a>):
<pre><code>class SampleGame extends Game {
  var batch: SpriteBatch = _
  var font: BitmapFont = _

  def create(): Unit = {
    batch = new SpriteBatch
    font = new BitmapFont
    setScreen(new MainMenuScreen(this))
  }

  def render(): Unit = super.render()

  def dispose(): Unit = {
    batch.dispose()
    font.dispose()
  }
}</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                See all the vars? See all the effects? See all the callbacks?
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't want to play by these rules. We're the cool new gals. We're the <b>Reactivsters</b>. And that's why we're going
                to break out of that framework and basically use <b>Rx Observables</b> for everything.
